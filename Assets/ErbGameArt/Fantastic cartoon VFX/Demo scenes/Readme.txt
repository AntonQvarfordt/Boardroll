NOTE:

For correct work as in demo scene you need enable "HDR" on main camera and add CC.asset(post processing profile)
with help of Post Processing behaviour script.

Using effects:
Just drag and drop prefab of effect on scene and use that :)

Using shaders:
Slash shader works only with particle system using "Custom vertex stream.xy". Use custom data x and y. One for slash range, another for slash distance.
Tornado shader works only with particle system using "Custom vertex stream.xy". Use custom data x. This value is responsible for dissolving the effect.

-------------------------------------
I recomend you to download free Post Processing Stack by Unity Technologies and use post effect "bloom".
Effects on video and screenshots are made using the settings file "CC" (Demo scene folder) for PPS.
-------------------------------------

P.S. Please rate the asset in the store, this will help me a lot.
30+ reviews and I will update an asset (I will add new prefabs and support for LWRP) =P
